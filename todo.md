# To do
## Aim: to build my website using tachyons.


March 26, 2018
**Have to wonder if it's easier / more beneficial to turn all minima classes into tachyons style, and just link to the tachyons css file.**


**Options**
- Change minima to tachyons.
- Add files to jeykll-tachyons (includes updating / replacing existing files)

[] fix tachyons includes so structured like minima

ie
head / header / footer / google-analytics

Put classes on header into tachyons
